Pulse Channel
=================

There are up to 32 Pulse Channles in the hardware. Each channel can be configured to generate a waveform. The waveform is defined by a set of parameters, including the start time, start address, wave length, gain factor, scale address, sustain, and coefficients. The waveform is generated by a polynomial function of the form:

.. math::
    p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i

where :math:`a_i` are the coefficients.

The output of the waveform values are positive integers. The waveform is generated by the FPGA and sent to the DAC to generate the analog signal, as illustrated in the following diagram:

Each waveform has three modes of operation: rise, sustain, and fall. Fall is the mirror of rise. In the image above, rise has been highlighted in blue, sustain in green, and fall in red.

The diagram shows two waveforms with arbirary polynomials generated by the FPGA. The first waveform has a start time of ~50 ns, with a length of 8 samples, with each sample being 10 ns. It has a sustain value of 3, and the gain factor and scale address are both 1. The second waveform has a lenghth of 3 samples and a sustain value of 2.
